name=Place Marker
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Place Marker provides a convenient way of adding placemarks to a vector layer.
version=1.1.0
author=Jens Renken (Marum, University of Bremen)
email=renken@marum.de

about=Place Marker provides a quick and easy way of creating point layers and adding features with preset attributes.
    Unlike using the built-in editing tools, the created layer contains the necessary attributes, and newly added features are
    committed directly to the data store and should be available immediately on other QGIS instances. 
    It addresses to usage scenarios where QGIS in conjunction with the "PosiView" plugin serves as an online visualization
    and navigation tool, e.g for scientific subsea surveys with remotely operated or autonomous vehicles.
    It allows marking and sharing interesting places and events during the dive.
